## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Responsive Club Website*, 
wherein we had to design a responsive home page for a real or imaginary club.  I chose to 
design a home page for an imaginary film club in St Austell, Cornwall, named *Penwithick Movie Club*. 
My solution met the following requirements:

- make images change width percentages when the screen is resized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- use *CSS media queries* to change page layout and behaviour in response to certain size breakpoints
- employ responsive units *em* and *rem* to style elements using width and padding

## Technologies
  
I used **HTML5** and **CSS3** to complete this project.  More specifically, I used **CSS Flexbox**, **CSS Grid** 
and **CSS Media Queries** to ensure that the design of this website is fully responsive and performs well on 
devices of differing screen size. As the screen size decreases, the 12-movie poster grid changes from a 
4 x 4 grid (with 4 posters spanning 2 rows) to a 3 x 4 grid, then to a 2 x 6 grid, and finally to a 1 x 12 grid. 
As the movie poster layout changes, the order of the movie posters also changes at each breakpoint.
